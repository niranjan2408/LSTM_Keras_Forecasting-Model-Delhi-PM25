# LSTM_Keras_Forecasting-Model-Delhi-PM25
Forecasting Model on Delhi PM 2.5 using LSTM Keras Tensorflow

Business Objective:
Particulate matter (PM ) has been recorded in Delhi to understand the air quality on an hourly basis for 4 months. 
Our objective is to forecast the data available .
 

Data Set Details:
PM2. 5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, 
which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair and usually seen through a microscope.

<This dataset consists of 2300 observations>
